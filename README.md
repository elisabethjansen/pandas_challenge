## District Summary 
The Distric Summary showed that across 15 schools in the district, and 39,170 students, only 65.17% of students were passing both math and reading with a score over 70 in both subjects.

## School Summary
The School summary and its associated DataFrames analyzed performance across math and reading, for each school within the district. In this analysis students needed to score 70 or above to be considered passing. School success was evaluated on the factors of school type (charter vs district), school size, and school spending per student. Additionally, within each school, average math and reading scores were assessed by grade. 

The highest and lowest performing schools were determined based on the the percentage of students passing both reading and math. 

### Conclusions
The School Summary analysis showed higher overall performance in charter schools as compared to district schools with the top 5 highest performing schools being all charter schools and the 5 lowest performing schools being all district schools.
    Top Performing School: Cabrera High School (91.33% Overall Passing)
    Lowest Performing School: Johnson High School (53.53% Overall Passing)

A higher per student budget is not an indicator of student success. There is an inverse relationship between the Budget per Student and % Overall Passing. Which is to say that this set of data indicates higher overall performance in schools with a lower budget to student ratio (i.e. as the budget per student increases the % overall passing decreases).
